# Minecraft-Bedrock-Server-Install-Scripts

These are some simple bash scripts I made for installing or updating the bedrock-server for linux.

I threw them together in about 4 hours. 

These are also the first bash scripts I ever created.

I didn't test them especially thoroughly.

I also only used them on my laptop/server using arch.

#### So, with saying all of that, feel free to use these or improve them. Shoot over a pull request if you feel so inclined.

(These scripts are largely based on the tutorial found here: https://pimylifeup.com/ubuntu-minecraft-bedrock-server/)

Enjoy!

### Requires:
- curl, wget, unzip, and grep (for the scripts)

- openssl (for the server)
